# E-commerce Admin Dashboard

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), using TailwindCSS, Prisma, MySQL, shadcn/ui and more.

## Acknowledgments

This was made with [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5miHyP6lExg) from Antonio <3

It's my second project after a long break from coding, so it's perfect for revision before developing serious projects.

## Todo List

- [x] Add regex hex checking in `/api/colors` routes
- [x] Add new icon.
- [x] Basic 404 page.
- [x] Add .env.example
- [ ] Change way of sending `FRONTEND_STORE_URL` to support multiple stores by stripe
