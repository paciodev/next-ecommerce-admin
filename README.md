# E-commerce Admin Dashboard

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), using TailwindCSS, Prisma, MySQL, shadcn/ui and more.

## Acknowledgments

This was made with [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5miHyP6lExg) from Antonio <3

It's my second project after a long break from coding, so it's perfect for revision before developing serious projects.

## Todo List

- [ ] Fix welcoming "Create store" modal, if you try to spam closing it, it will react weirdly.

## Features

_i'll list them soon_

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
